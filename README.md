# Haunted_House_Game-JS
This repository contains a short haunted house escape game as test of JS skills. THIS FILE HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED ON FIREFOX THUS FAR.

The escape game is click based, and it is not made apparent to the user what objects are clickable and which are not. The goal is to work your way through the haunted house. Beware: if you click the wrong object, you will have only 1 minute remaining to escape the hosue.

Included at the top of each page is a display of mouse coordinates.  Coordinates for game clicks were calculated based off of the page layout.  Being new to Javascript I am uncertain whether this was the correct reference to use to insure all users can see the code.
